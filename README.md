Our project is building a free education website where students can learn programming languages like Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, and C++ and many more with just a click. We'll provide drawn up YouTube playlists from popular YouTubers, making learning easier and faster. Users can also take quizzes and follow roadmaps for different courses. The website will have a user-friendly interface and will be responsive for different platforms.
